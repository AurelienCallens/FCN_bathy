# Bathymetric inversion for nearshore areas with video monitoring and deep learning


## Description

This repository contains python tools to perform bathymetric inversion based on deep learning algorithms. The deep learning algorithms (Unet and Pix2Pix) are implemented in tensorflow. 
During training, you have the choice to train on CPU or GPU if you have one.
